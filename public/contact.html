            <h3><span>What is the first step of the house buying process?</span><i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></h3>
            <p>The first stage in purchasing a house is to get pre-approved for a mortgage. Getting a lender’s
               pre-approval letter kicks off the procedure in the right way. Here’s why:

               To start, you must know how much money you may borrow. Narrowing down your search for houses to suitable
               properties saves time since you won’t be looking at homes outside of your spending budget. (Pre-approvals
               also help prevent buyer’s remorse due to falling in love with a property that is too expensive or that
               they can’t afford.)

               Second, the loan quotation provided by your lender will show how much cash you will need for the down
               payment and closing costs. You may need more time to save money, sell other assets, or accept mortgage
               gift funds from the family in any case. Ultimately, having been pre-approved for a mortgage shows that
               you are a serious buyer to your real estate agent and the property seller.

               A pre-approval is generally required by most real estate agents when showing houses in the higher-end
               luxury market; luxury property sellers will only allow pre-screened (and verified) buyers to see their
               properties. This is designed to keep undesirable “Looky Lous” out and protect the seller’s privacy.
               Furthermore, sellers are provided additional security from robbers attempting to case a home (identifying
               security systems, locating expensive artwork, or other high-value personal property).</p>
         </div>

         <div class="box">
            <h3><span>How long does it take to buy a home?</span><i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></h3>
            <p>It takes approximately 10 to 12 weeks to buy a house from the start (looking online) to the conclusion
               (closing escrow). The typical time it takes to complete the escrow process on the house under normal
               market conditions is 30 to 45 days. Homebuyers who pay with cash have can shorten that timeframe by
               weeks.

               The housing market is susceptible to economic conditions. When the economy is strong, and there are a lot
               of sales, buying a house may take longer than usual in hot markets with a lot of activity. That’s because
               when business picks up, several parties connected with the transaction get behind.

               A high demand to purchase a home will increase the need for property appraisals and inspections (assuming
               no other factors affect supply or demand). No more appraisers or inspectors will be available to do the
               work because a surge in house sales has increased the need for property appraisals and inspections. </p>
         </div>

         <div class="box">
            <h3><span>What is a Seller’s Market?</span><i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></h3>
            <p>In a sellers’ market, rising demand for houses raises home values. Here are some of the factors behind
               demand:

               Economic factors – The real estate market is a highly interconnected system in which demand, supply, and
               pricing are all affected by numerous external factors. External conditions such as the local labor market
               heating up and bringing an influx of new people before more inventory may be built to raise home prices.
               Interest rates are decreasing, making homes more affordable and enticing new buyers to enter the market,
               especially first-time homebuyers who can pay for larger residences due to falling expenses.
               A short-term spike in interest rates – If interest rates rise dramatically for a brief period, it’s
               possible that “on the fence” buyers will be forced to buy if they believe the upward trend will continue.
               The higher the interest rate goes up, the less affordability the buyer has.
               Excess inventory – because of a shortage of new construction, there are fewer homes for sale. Prices for
               existing residences may rise as a result of a lack of available units.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="box">
            <h3><span>What is a Buyer’s Market?</span><i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></h3>
            <p>A buyer’s market is defined by decreasing house values and reduced demand. Several elements may influence
               long-term, and short-term buyer demand, including Economic disruption – a significant corporation shuts
               down its operations, laying off employees.

               Interest rates trending higher – The number of potential purchasers in the market is reduced because
               interest rates are increasing. Thus the amount people can borrow to purchase a home is cut, lowering the
               total number of potential buyers. Home prices drop to match demand and purchasers get better offers.
               Short-term interest rate decreases – can provide borrowers with a temporary advantage by providing them
               greater purchasing power before home prices have time to react to the most recent interest rate
               adjustments.
               High inventory – A new development may cause downward pressure on prices of existing homes nearby,
               especially if they lack highly desirable characteristics (such as contemporary appliances).
               Natural disasters – such as a recent earthquake or flooding, may reduce home values in the area where
               they occurred.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="box">
            <h3><span>What is a Stratified Market?</span><i class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></h3>
            <p>In a stratified market, supply and demand characteristics differ according to a price point in the same
               area (typically by city). For example, home purchases for houses over $1.5 million may be lively
               (seller’s market), while property sales for houses under $750,000 may be sluggish (buyer’s market). This
               scenario occurs on rare occasions. Let’s move on to more real estate questions.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="box">
            <h3>How much do I have to pay an agent to help me buy a property?<span></span><i
                  class="fas fa-angle-down"></i>
            </h3>
            <p>An agent does not charge homebuyers any commissions or fees to purchase a property. Here’s why:

               There are two real estate agents involved in most home transactions: one on behalf of the seller and
               another on behalf of the buyer.

               Sellers pay listing brokers to represent them and promote the property. Advertising costs, such as radio
               spots, magazine ads, television, and internet advertising, are an example of this. The home will also be
               added to the local multiple listing service (MLS), allowing other agents in the area (and across the
               country) to search for and purchase.

               Buyers’ agents, also known as buyer’s agents, are paid by the listing broker to bring buyers to the
               table. The listing broker divides the listing fee with the buyer’s agent when the house is sold. As a
               result, buyers do not pay their agents.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="box">
            <h3>What kind of Credit Score do I need to buy a house?<i
                  class="fas fa-angle-down"></i></h3>
            <p>Most loan programs require a FICO score of 620 or greater. Borrowers with higher credit scores are seen
               to be less risky to the lender, and as a result, down payment requirements and interest rates are
               typically lower for them. Homebuyers with poorer credit histories may need to bring additional funds (or
               accept a higher interest rate).
